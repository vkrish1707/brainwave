Here’s a refined version of the “why” and “how” section you requested based on the changes and additions mentioned:

Why

	•	Implemented a right sidebar: To manage the growing number of options and maintain a clean, accessible UI, a right sidebar was introduced. This allowed moving certain controls from the header, which was becoming crowded.
	•	Added font size control: Users now have more flexibility to adjust the font size, with a checkbox toggle to enable larger or smaller text based on their preference, making the interface more accessible.
	•	Show only my columns: This feature enhances the grid’s usability by displaying only the relevant columns based on ownership and access permissions, giving users a focused view of their data.
	•	Show notes functionality: The ability to display notes in the form of a small triangle has been added, providing contextual information through tooltips to make the data more informative without crowding the main display.
	•	Show aside I ID: By introducing this feature, users can toggle the visibility of the Aside I ID in the SOC column, enabling quick reference to important identifiers without overwhelming the view.
	•	Color-based filtering: A color legend with checkboxes was added to allow users to filter data based on specific color codes, offering an intuitive way to segment and visualize data.

How

	•	Sidebar and checkbox updates: The header was decluttered by moving font size and column visibility controls to the right sidebar. Specific methods were implemented to manage each of these options:
	•	Font size control: The existing font size toggle was converted into a checkbox, enabling users to increase or decrease font size dynamically.
	•	Show only my columns: A method was introduced to filter and display only the accessible columns based on ownership, allowing users to focus solely on relevant data.
	•	Show notes feature: A checkbox was added, which, when checked, displays a triangle indicating the presence of notes. Hovering over the triangle reveals the note in a tooltip.
	•	Show aside I ID: A checkbox was provided to toggle the visibility of the Aside I ID within the SOC column, making it easily accessible when needed.
	•	Color filtering legend: A color filter accordion was added, displaying a list of color options. Users can select multiple colors and apply the filter to see only the relevant data. Methods like handleColorChange and handleApply were developed to manage the user’s selections and update the grid accordingly.
	•	Updated methods: The custom cell renderer was updated with parameters to accommodate the new options. This included:
	•	handleShowNotesChange, handleShowAsideIChange, and handleColorChange.
	•	Methods to filter columns and adjust cell heights based on the maximum object height for rows, ensuring that the display adapts dynamically based on content.

This approach ensures that the new functionality integrates smoothly into the user interface, providing greater control and flexibility while maintaining optimal performance and accessibility.
