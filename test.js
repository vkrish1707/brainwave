Perfect üëç you‚Äôre at the right step now. Let‚Äôs go through this in two parts:

‚∏ª

üîß Step 1: Okta Developer Console Setup
	1.	Redirect URIs
	‚Ä¢	In your Okta app settings, add the frontend callback URL.
For example, if you‚Äôre running Next.js locally:

http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback


	‚Ä¢	If you plan to host it later, add that domain as well (e.g., https://myapp.company.com/api/auth/callback).

	2.	Assign Test Users
	‚Ä¢	In Okta Developer Console ‚Üí Directory ‚Üí People ‚Üí Add Person.
	‚Ä¢	Create 2 users with email + password (and set them as ‚ÄúActive‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Assign your app to these test users:
	‚Ä¢	Go to Applications ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Assignments ‚Üí Assign ‚Üí People ‚Üí pick your test users.
	3.	Collect App Credentials
	‚Ä¢	From General ‚Üí Client Credentials, note:
	‚Ä¢	Client ID
	‚Ä¢	Client Secret
	‚Ä¢	Issuer URL (looks like https://dev-xxxxx.okta.com/oauth2/default)
	4.	Enable Authorization Code Flow (with PKCE)
	‚Ä¢	In your app settings, make sure ‚ÄúAuthorization Code‚Äù with PKCE is enabled for sign-in.
	‚Ä¢	This is the recommended flow for Next.js SPAs.

‚∏ª

üñ•Ô∏è Step 2: Frontend (Next.js) Integration

At a high level, what your frontend needs to do:
	‚Ä¢	When the app loads, check if the user is authenticated.
	‚Ä¢	If not ‚Üí redirect to Okta login page.
	‚Ä¢	On successful login ‚Üí Okta redirects back to your callback URL with an auth code.
	‚Ä¢	Your backend exchanges that code for tokens (ID token + access token).
	‚Ä¢	Backend verifies tokens and stores the user in MongoDB.
	‚Ä¢	User is now logged in and can call protected APIs.

‚úÖ AI Prompt for Frontend Implementation

Here‚Äôs a ready-to-use prompt you can give to your AI agent to implement the Next.js side:

‚∏ª

Prompt for AI Agent:
‚ÄúIntegrate Okta authentication into my existing Next.js frontend. Use the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE. Steps:
	1.	Configure environment variables for NEXT_PUBLIC_OKTA_CLIENT_ID, NEXT_PUBLIC_OKTA_ISSUER, NEXT_PUBLIC_OKTA_REDIRECT_URI, and NEXT_PUBLIC_OKTA_SCOPES.
	2.	On page load, check if the user is authenticated. If not, redirect them to the Okta sign-in page.
	3.	Handle the callback at /api/auth/callback, exchange the authorization code for tokens by calling the backend, and store the session securely (cookie or httpOnly session).
	4.	Once authenticated, fetch the user‚Äôs profile (id, email, name) and display it in the UI.
	5.	If the user logs out, clear the session and redirect back to login.
	6.	Ensure the frontend can only access protected routes after authentication.
	7.	Style the login experience to match the existing dark theme of the app.‚Äù

‚ö°Quick tip: You can use Okta React SDK or just plain next-auth with Okta as the provider (simplifies a lot).

Do you also want me to prepare the matching backend AI prompt for handling the Okta token exchange and user storage in MongoDB, so your AI agent can build both sides together?
