Hey [Manager’s Name], I wanted to take today and tomorrow off because my wife and baby are leaving for India for the next 4 months, and I’d really like to spend some time with them before they go. I’m happy to make up the time by working on Saturday and Sunday to keep things on track, and from next week onward, I’ll also be able to focus more fully on work with them away. Let me know if this is okay. Thanks a lot!
